# shetran_index
This is a catchment file management script for the SHETRAN Program
The python scripts in this folder must be copied into the folder where the catchment files are stored.
These scripts use the executable 'prepare-liz2.2.4a.exe' to prepare the required rundata file as input for SHETRAN.
  Therefore, this executable 'prepare-liz2.2.4a' must be within the folder as well.
Similarly, the scripts call the SHETRAN executable (version 4.4) from a folder named 'program'
  This folder named 'program'must also be within the folder where the catchment files are stored.
